# Game of Life.
A console based simulation of the famous game "Game of Life" written in C++.

## What is the Game of Life?
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

## About this project
This is a console based implementation of Conway's Game of Life in C++. It takes input points from the file named `input.txt` and stores the expected output points in output.txt.

## Installation
To run this program, you need a C++ compiler. You can also use an IDE to compile, execute and debug this program.

## Usage
Once the code is compiled, you can run it as any other C++ program. 

## Sample Input/Output
Sample input points should be provided in a `input.txt` file and output is stored in `output.txt` file.
